# Rates-Volatility-Yield-Curve-Regime-Analysis
This project analyzes U.S. Treasury yield-curve dynamics and associated rate volatility regimes using publicly available market data. Because on-the-run Treasury yields and swap curves are not accessible via public APIs, the analysis uses duration-weighted Treasury ETFs as curve proxies to study relative curve shape, regime transitions, and long-end volatility behavior.

The goal is not to estimate absolute yields, but to monitor curve steepening, flattening, and inversion dynamics and understand how duration and curve risk evolve across regimes.
